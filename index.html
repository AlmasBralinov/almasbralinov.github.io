                <div class="content-description">
                  <p>I'm a mathematician who has been working in the field for over 12 years. I have always been passionate about math and have spent many years solving extra problems, participating in various math circles, and competing in math olympiads. However, I found that this was no longer enough for me and decided to start teaching. I formed two groups of six students to prepare for the oral geometry exam. At the age of 16, I discovered my true passion for teaching and have since taught hundreds of students over 10,000 hours of math classes. One of the key factors in helping students learn math quickly is selecting the right sequence of topics. However, this can be challenging when working with multiple students with different needs. My vision is to use Artificial Intelligence to create more accurate sequences of topics, in order to make math more accessible to more people.

                    <p>I became a Co-Founder and CEO of the GoBoston project after graduating from high school. GoBoston.kz is an educational portal that organizes face-to-face university visits in the United States. It is intended for students who are motivated to study in the United States and wish to observe the country and universities from the inside while competing in mathematics and programming competitions. So, for example, students from Kazakhstan have participated in the Harvard MIT Math Tournament every year since 2018, except for the year of the 2020 pandemic. In February 2020, one of our teams won the CodeDay Hackathon New York.
                    </p>
                    <p>Until 2019, GoBoston.kz was a non-profit initiative in which participants solely paid for their flights and lodging. The platform is backed by the directors of Kazakhstan's premier schools, including FIZMAT, HaileyBury, and BIL networks.</p>

                    <p>Unplanned free time arose in the first year of the 2020 pandemic when A+ Education shifted to a remote model and GoBoston.kz was suspended for a spell. I also realized that, unlike programmers, mathematicians have it tougher in this aspect because the well-known codeforces.com domain conducted online programming contests, whereas mathematicians had no alternative but to compete in face-to-face Olympiads. This is how my friends and I came up with the idea for mathforces.com, an online math competition platform. We had a terrific response in the first few months following our debut, with over 2,000 active users who were offered two contests every week. As a result, the selection for the European Olympiad among females was held on our site, where Kazakhstan's national squad was formed.
                    </p>
                    <p>We tested mathforces in the early years, as we have in many previous initiatives. Finally convinced of the presence of feedback and having formed a strategic vision, a team of 17 programmers, mathematicians, designers, SMM, and business sector representatives was formed in the summer of 2022 and began work on integerly.com - a rebranding of mathforces with the same ideas as online olympiads, but with the addition of preparation for the Olympiads based on past performances. As the project's initial co-founder, I assumed the role of business development leader, responsible for the project's strategic development as well as the design, SMM, and mathematical content sectors.

                    <p>The Daryn Republican Scientific and Practical Center of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan established the first Association of Kazakhstani Mathematicians in August 2021. This organization serves as a council for promoting and popularizing Olympiad mathematics in the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>It featured long-term jury members, problem solvers, and trainers. I was also invited to the council, which is a big honor.
                      The Association's meetings are held remotely once a week. It debates and decides on subjects such as the design of laws for the republican cycle Olympiads, discussions of the selection processes at each round, the number of compilers and inspectors for assignments, and much more. So, for example, it was decided last year to hold the second district stage in the format of testing, which overcomes the annual problems with verifying work.

                    <p>The Kazakhstan Mathematics team participates annually in the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO). The Association of Mathematicians was responsible for selecting two leaders and one observer from our team. I was honored to be selected as an observer from Kazakhstan for IMO 2022. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend due to a late notification, which caused me not to have enough time to prepare the necessary documents. I hope to have another chance in 2023.

                    <p>I was invited to serve on the jury for the 15th International Zhautykov Olympiad in 2019. It was a fantastic honor, and I gladly accepted it, becoming the youngest jury member at the time at 18.
                      Since then, I have served as a jury member in contests such as the International Zhautykov Olympiad, the Republican Olympiad's regional and final stages, the Asia-Pacific Mathematical Olympiad, the Silk Road Mathematical Competition, and various local mathematics competitions. In general, my responsibilities include the following: Addressing concerns regarding task circumstances during the tour, Checking work, Engaging in appeals or coordination.
                    </p>
                    <p>The jury commission frequently assigns captains for issues. Therefore, during the Republican Olympiad in 2021, I was the captain for two geometry questions for grades 10 and 11.

                    <p>In December 2019, I performed as the European Mathematical Cup's representative and organizer. The Olympiad was held within the boundaries of the FIZMAT in Almaty. I established a jury and proctor team with whom we handled all administrative tasks. The competition drew more than 80 students from grades 7-9.

                    <p>In the spring of 2021, I fulfilled one of my greatest dreams by beginning to participate in sports, specifically triathlon actively. I've liked sports since I was a child and once imagined myself as a professional football player, but I arrived at triathlon with limited skills. I couldn't swim, I couldn't run more than 4 kilometers at a time, and I rode a bicycle for the final time in my childhood. So I joined, the BI Group Triathlon, a local amateur group. I thought I had a talent for sports, so I expected tremendous growth, and my desire to train only rose. So, in October 2021, after completing the requisite tests, I was welcomed into Red Lava Team, the CIS's first semi-professional triathlon team.
                    </p>
                    <p>After a year of triathlon, I won first place in the republican sprint competition in April, and second place in the Ironman 70.3 Vietnam in my age category of 18-24 in May, qualifying for the Ironman 70.3 World Championship.
                      </p>
                    <p>I had a couple more victories during the season, including a third-place finish at the Ironman 70.3 Astana. Running is my forte, so I entered the top 1% of one of my country's most important races, the Astana 10km.
                    </p>
                    <p>I finished the Ironman70.3 World Championship on October 29, 2022, in St. George, Utah, earning All-World Athlete Silver Status. I hope to be the Ironman World Championship 18-24 age group world champion in the next two years.

                    <p>In elementary school, I was one of the top students in math. My father drove me to the entrance tests for one of the country's most prestigious schools, the 165 lyceum for bright children. I passed the exams, and starting in 5th grade, I began attending the Olympiad mathematics circle in this new school after basic classes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Three years later, as an eighth-grade student, I finished second at the city stage in mathematics for the ninth grade, allowing me to advance to the republican final, where I got fourth place. Following that, I advanced to the final stage of the Republican Olympiad on an annual basis.
                      </p>
                    <p>At the end of the school year, I continue to study areas of higher mathematics on my own, such as mathematical analysis and linear algebra. I was authorized to compete in the International Math Competition in August 2022, where I won the Silver Prize.

                    <p>I assumed talent was a preoccupation, a non-existent idea when I was 16–19. I acknowledged that everybody could do well in mathematics. Then it was sufficient to communicate the content to the students exceptionally well, and the results would improve; that is, the entire point is in the teachers, not the pupils. At the same time, I would like other students who do not attend our A+ Education Center to have access to quality programs in which everything is made plain. I produced Science World, a popular science magazine for middle school students, and tried to structure each section as though we were discussing the content in our A+ Education class. The exam project was a magazine for 7th-grade students, divided into three sections: mathematics, geometry, and physics. With the cooperation of the school administration, we printed more than 120 copies and handed them free of charge to the entire 7th grade at the 165th lyceum.
                    </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, we concluded that the additional material did not elicit the anticipated response among the kids; most of the youngsters did not read it, but those who were already succeeding in their studies did. We attempted to make our publications and activity collections available on the Internet, but we were still looking for an audience. As a result, ScienceWorld did not live up to the original plan, and the project was shortly abandoned.
                      </p>
                    <p>Now I subscribe to all of the same beliefs. Still, I see that the maps of reality are broader and that the outcome is determined by the amount of discipline, concentration, and thinking generated by the urge of self-preservation and hierarchical and social instincts, and not simply by teachers. It was a fantastic experience.

                    <p>Solve.kz has evolved into a continuation of ScienceWorld.kz. If the magazine was developed for the school curriculum and did not receive a positive response, Solve.kz became a portal that brings together more specialized content, such as SAT, UNT, and Olympiad mathematics preparation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Users gained access to a massive database of materials by creating a personal account, which was worked on by 6 mathematicians, each of whom co-founded the project, investing more than 2000 hours in content production alone. I was primarily in charge of the Olympiad mathematics portion, which includes many of the resources provided by A+ Education.
                      </p>
                    <p>We thought Solve.kz was bound for unqualified success because of its specialty in specialized tests and competitions in mathematics, and we expected our audience to use such resources. Unfortunately, no response has been received. There were a lot of registrations, we promoted the platform widely in the mathematicians' community, among physics and mathematics schools, and it appeared that many Olympiad participants would continue to utilize solve.kz resources, which were free and open source. To our amazement, even students from faraway regions, where coaches are frequently problematic, did not become active users, let alone inhabitants of large cities, where there are numerous face-to-face training centers.
                    </p>
                    <p>We determined that Solve.kz is ahead of its time, as online items in 2019 needed to be more warmly appreciated. When humanity is more familiar with remote learning during the pandemic, solve.kz will have a far better chance of success, but only as part of something larger, becoming part of integerly.com.

                    <p>I'm sufficiently in active projects like A + Education and GoBoston.kz during my first years after graduating. "Am I excellent at it because I'm a good mathematician or an entrepreneur?" I wondered. I wanted to put myself out there in a non-educational project.
                    </p>
                    <p>After visiting Thailand several times and seeing its abundant supply of exotic fruits for Central Asia, I decided to supply them to us in Kazakhstan. I planned to build an exotic fruit island in a shopping center, but I required investments, so I decided to test the concept.
                      I decided to sell fruits on Instagram and my website. The idea of retail sales did not appeal to me, so I decided to sell fruit sets as gifts for the New Year, birthdays, Valentine's Day, International Women's Day, and other holidays. I began the project in the pre-winter season when many holidays were anticipated.
                      </p>
                    <p>Organizing delivery was a huge success. After traveling through all of the wholesale rows and speaking with a dozen suppliers, I discovered a point that supplies garments and fruits from Thailand at one of the country's largest markets. And thus began the beginning of sales.
                      The project quickly gained traction, and for holidays such as New Year's, I stopped accepting orders a week before the event. The notion of gift boxes worked, and further expansion appeared obvious, but there were significant issues with fruit storage, which gradually degraded. Because a set of fruits had a shelf life of only a few days, we occasionally did not leave a positive impression on buyers.
                      By the end of March, I was continuously sleep-deprived, and I knew I was overburdened with several projects.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Exotics.kz appealed to me, but it ran counter to my belief in high-quality goods and services. I feel that if you are going to do anything, you should do it well. Furthermore, the initiative did not fit into the larger goal of popularizing mathematics, which I am much more passionate about. Exotics.kz was online for four months, from December 2019 to February 2020.
                      </p>
                      <p>I gained a lot of experience in organizing logistics, working with suppliers, SMM-managers, couriers, and sorters, 
                        which showed me the importance of integrity, and realized that I was good at both educational projects and entrepreneurship in general.</p>

                    <p>The Daryn Republican Scientific and Practical Center of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan established the first Association of Kazakhstani Mathematicians in August 2021. This organization serves as a council for promoting and popularizing Olympiad mathematics in the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>It featured long-term jury members, problem solvers, and trainers. I was also invited to the council, which is a big honor.
                      The Association's meetings are held remotely once a week. It debates and decides on subjects such as the design of laws for the republican cycle Olympiads, discussions of the selection processes at each round, the number of compilers and inspectors for assignments, and much more. So, for example, it was decided last year to hold the second district stage in the format of testing, which overcomes the annual problems with verifying work.
                      </p>
                    <p>The Council is also in charge of selecting the first and second leaders and overseeing the International Math Olympiad. I am one of the board's youngest members. I also have international travel experience with GoBoston.kz, including representing Kazakhstan as a lookout for IMO 2022. Still, unfortunately, the necessary funding and candidacy needed to be organized in time, so I could not join the team, but I hope such an opportunity will be realized in 2023.
